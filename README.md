# odin-recipes
Hi everyone.
So this is my first project and I hope to do my very best.

So my goals for the this project are:
1. Get better at git commit.
2. Expand my knowledge of tags and elements.
3. Get better at HTML.
4. Gain more knowledge of Git.

ABOUT THE PROJECT: This is a very simple project where I will design a website using only HTML. The website will be mainly about of various recipes and their step by step preparations.

Thanks.
