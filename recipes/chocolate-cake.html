    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and shift flour to ensure a moist cake.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees <sup>o</sup>F for ten minutes. Lightly grease your 9-inch baking 
            pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
            Add eggs one at a time. Combine red food coloring and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture. </li>
        <li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl. Add flour, alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Then finally pour in the boiling water. The batter will be runny and thin but don't worry, I promise you it will come out amazing</li> 
        <li>Pour into the prepared pan. </li>
        <li>Bake for about half an hour, or until a clean toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. </li>
        <li>Bring out of the oven and allow to cool in the pan for ten minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently bring the cake out of the pan, by tapping on the bottom, unto a cooling rack.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for at least an hour or more before frosting or serving.</li>
